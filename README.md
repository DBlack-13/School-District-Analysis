# Overview of the School District Analysis
  The purpose of this analysis was to see how impactful the academic dishonestly of Thomas High School's ninth grader's reading and math scores would be compared to as if they were honest in the first place. The school board was not sure what the outcome would be so they had asked us to re-analys the data with the updated scores to see if it really made a difference in the reporting.
