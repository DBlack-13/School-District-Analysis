# School-District-Analysis
### Overview of the School District Analysis
  The purpose of this analysis was to see how impactful the academic dishonestly of Thomas High School's ninth grader's reading and math scores would be compared to as if they were honest in the first place. The school board was not sure what the outcome would be so they had asked us to re-analys the data with the updated scores to see if it really made a difference in the reporting.
### Results
  * How is the District Summary Affected
    * The Disctrict Summary is hardly affected by the inaccuracy because only 1 grade in 1 school alone was affected.

             As you can see, there is hardly a changed in any of the numbers
  * How is the School Summary Affected
    * The School Summary is expected to have a difference in scores. Since the originial data had corrupted information in relation to THS, the adjusted information related to THS has better numbers since we removed the corrupted data from Ninth Graders.
